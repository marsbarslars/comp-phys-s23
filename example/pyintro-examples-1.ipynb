Write a python program to read the file to recreate the array *x*. Then make a histogram of *x* and display it. Make sensible choices about the binning and the axes (linear? semilog? log-log?). How would you want to display these data? Make sure to label the horizontal and vertical axes. Also, include the statistics box. To that end you can use the code in /home/golfclass/fgolf/data/ccHist.py.  Hint: for the npy files, look at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/routines.io.html.  In this case the binary .npy file is 3 times smaller than the equivalent .txt file."
